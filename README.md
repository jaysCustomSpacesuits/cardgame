This is just a very stripped down version of something like the Pokemon or YuGiOh card games. I created this game to work on my OOP skills.

Python 3.7

Only uses the standard library. No external packages are needed.

Clone the repo and '''python3 cardgame.py''' to play.

Feedback is appreciated.

Next steps will be adding a GUI element with Arcade.
